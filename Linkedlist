<B>Linked List</b>
Why do we need linked list?
1)	Dynamic Size:
Size of the array is fixed.
2)	Ease of insertion and deletion.
Inserting a new element is expensive when the number of elements exceeds the size of the array.
	Drawback:
1)	Random Access:
Elements needs to be accessed sequentially starting from the first node. 
2)	Extra memory:
Extra memory needs to be created everytime there is a new insertion
3)	Cache: Not cache friendly
