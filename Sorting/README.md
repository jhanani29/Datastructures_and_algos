**Sorting Algorithm**

Sorting which does not require extra space for comparision - *"in 
place Sorting"*

Sorting which needs extra space for comparision - *"not in place Sorting" *

STL has sorting function. Internally it performs quick sort with the order of N*log N 
Eg: sort(Start_address,end_address); ==> sort(a,a+10);

Types of Sorting:
i) Bubble sort
ii) Insertion sort
iii) Selection sort
iv) Shell sort
v) Merge sort
vi) Quick sort

Bubble sort:

Quick sort:

    Complexity: O(n long n) --> Average case running time
    O(n^2) --> worst case running time
